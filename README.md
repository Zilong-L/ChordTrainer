# Chord Practising App

Welcome to the [Chord Practising App](https://Zilong-L.github.io/ChordTrainer/)! It's a simple and efficient tool to help you play chords faster.

## Features

- **Random Chord Generation**: Get a new chord to play each time you play the current one correctly.
- **Instant Feedback**: Know immediately if you played the chord correctly.
- **Simple Interface**: Easy to use and navigate.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Website**: Launch the app in your browser.
2. **Play the Chord**: Follow the generated chord notation.
3. **Get a New Chord**: Once you play the chord correctly, a new chord will be generated.

## Supported Browsers

- **Browsers Tested**: Works well on Firefox and Edge on Windows.
- **Safari**: Rumored to not support MIDI input, but not tested.

## Benefits

- **Practice Efficiently**: Improve your chord playing speed.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface makes practicing easy.
- **Real-Time Learning**: Immediate feedback helps you learn faster.

# TODOs

## Labor-Intensive Tasks

1. ~~**Show Note with Chord Type**~~
   ~~- Currently, only the root note is displayed.~~
   ~~- User has to choose a chord type from the sidebar to play.~~
   ~~- Make the interface more intuitive by showing the complete chord type along with the root note.~~

2. ~~**Support for Chord Inversions**~~
   ~~- Currently, only closed forms of chords are supported.~~
   ~~- Inversions can be detected and displayed but cannot be practiced.~~
   ~~- Implement practice functionality for chord inversions.~~

3. ~~**MIDI Improvement**~~
   ~~- Improve MIDI input handling to reduce wrong detections.~~
   ~~- Ensure notes are correctly registered and released when no notes are being played.~~

## Creative Tasks

4. **Evaluate WebAssembly Performance**

   - Determine if WebAssembly is faster than the pure JavaScript implementation.
   - Use browser APIs to compare performance, particularly for FFT results.

5. **Sound to Chord Transformation Algorithm**

   - Develop a robust algorithm for converting sound to chord notation.
   - This is crucial for accurate chord detection and feedback.

6. **Random Chord Generation**

   - Enhance the practice mode by generating random chords of selected types.
   - This will help users practice a variety of chords in a structured manner.

7. **Chord Progression Practice**

   - Implement functionality for practicing with real chord progressions.
   - Start with simple progressions and gradually introduce more complex sequences.

8. ~~**Open Form Chord Practice Support**~~

   - ~~Extend the app to support practice with open form chords.~~
   - ~~This will add variety and challenge to the practice sessions.~~

9. **Broken Chord Practice Support**
   - Introduce practice modes for broken chords (arpeggios).
   - This will help users develop finger dexterity and musicality.

## Future Enhancements

10. **Additional Features and Improvements**
    - Continuously gather user feedback to improve the app.
    - Consider adding more instruments and features based on user demand.
